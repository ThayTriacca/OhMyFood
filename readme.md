# About the project

Let's dive into the exciting details of this project! As part of my journey in the Web Developer program at OpenClassrooms, I embarked on an exhilarating adventure called Project #3. During this project, I dedicated my efforts to crafting an exceptional responsive website, harnessing the power of CSS3, HTML5, and the remarkable Sass CSS preprocessor.

Sass, a captivating acronym for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet, revolutionized my coding experience, elevating the quality of my work and simplifying the development process. Its advanced features became my secret weapon, empowering me to create a visually stunning and user-friendly website.

In my quest to ensure a seamless and accessible online presence, I turned to the dynamic hosting capabilities of GitHub Pages. Leveraging this powerful platform allowed me to showcase my website to a global audience and gather valuable insights.

Now, let's shine the spotlight on the star of this project: Ohmyfood! This captivating online platform embodies the vision of an ambitious startup determined to leave its mark in the fiercely competitive restaurant industry. Ohmyfood! serves as a comprehensive directory, curating an exquisite collection of menus from esteemed gastronomic establishments.
